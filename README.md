# patrikmarin-hub
This React Native application serves as a controller for my personal projects.

Currently it only sends my phone's location to my [website](https://github.com/marinp1/patrikmarin.fi) every 30 minutes.

Bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) and uses components from [react-native-elements](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements).

## Development
Requires physical device for location.
1. Start service with `npm start` or `npm start --reset-cache`
2. Open Android Studio and build & deploy
