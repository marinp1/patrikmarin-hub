# patrikmarin-hub
This React Native application serves as a controller for my personal projects.

Currently it only sends my phone's location to my [website](https://github.com/marinp1/patrikmarin.fi) every 30 minutes.

Bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) and uses some components from [react-native-elements](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements).

Pulse effect created with [react-native-pulse](https://github.com/sahlhoff/react-native-pulse).
